This is an alpha version. By following these instructions you acknowledge you are responsible for doing so.

Installation instructions:
Assuming C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Black Mesa is the game folder,
Extract the contents of the zip file into that folder.
The game may get stuck upon the first run. This is the game building the sound cache, you'll have to restart it and then
it will work.
This mod creates an additional localization named Unofficial Arabic - it should be selected automatically, but choose
it if it isn't.
It does not change the game's official Arabic localization, which at this time is not working correctly.


In order to uninstall the mod (and restore the English localization), remove the bms\custom\portl folder
