This is an alpha version. By following these instructions you acknowledge you are responsible for doing so.

Installation instructions:
Assuming C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Black Mesa\ is the game folder:

1. Extract the contents of the zip into the game folder
4. It is assumed you're running Windows 10 or 11 with Arabic support.
5. *** The following changes the display font for your entire system. *** Run apply_fonts_black_mesa_arabic.reg to change the default font to Simplified Arabic Fixed. Restart your PC.
6. When you start the game, set the game resolution to 1366 * 768 (higher resolutions might work as well, but the subtitles aren't as readable)

Notice not to change the localization to Arabic - this mod REPLACES the english localization.
Switching to Arabic will run the game's built in Arabic localization which isn't working.

In order to uninstall the mod (and restore the English localization)
1. Remove the bms\custom\portl folder
3. Remember to run remove_fonts_black_mesa.reg file. You may have to restart windows for the changes to take effect.
