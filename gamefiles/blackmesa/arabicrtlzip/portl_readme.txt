This is an alpha version. By following these instructions you acknowledge you are responsible for doing so.

Installation instructions:
Assuming C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Black Mesa\ is the game folder:

1. Extract the contents of the zip into the game folder
4. It is assumed you're running Windows 10 or 11 with Arabic support.
5. *** The following changes the display font for your entire system. *** Run apply_fonts_black_mesa_arabic.reg to change the default font to Courier New. Restart your PC.

This mod creates an additional localization named Unofficial Arabic -  it should be selected automatically, but choose
it if it isn't.
The patch does not change the game's official Arabic localization, which at this time is not working correctly.

In order to uninstall the mod (and restore the English localization)
1. Remove the bms\custom\portl folder
2. Remember to run remove_fonts_black_mesa.reg file. You may have to restart windows for the changes to take effect.
