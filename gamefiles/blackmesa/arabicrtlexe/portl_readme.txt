This is an alpha version. By following these instructions you acknowledge you are responsible for doing so.

Installation instructions:
Assuming C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Black Mesa\ is the game folder:

1. Extract the contents of the zip
2. Run install_black_mesa_a_win_rtl.exe and follow the installation instructions.
4. It is assumed you're running Windows 10 or 11 with Arabic support.
5. *** The following changes the display font for your entire system. *** Run apply_fonts_black_mesa_arabic.reg to replace Segoe UI with Courier New. Restart your PC.

This mod creates an additional localization named Unofficial Arabic - choose this in the menu.
It does not change the game's official Arabic localization, which at this time is not working correctly.

In order to uninstall the mod (and restore the English localization)
1. Run install_black_mesa_a_win_rtl.exe and follow the uninstallation instructions.
2. Remember to run remove_fonts_black_mesa.reg file. You may have to restart windows for the changes to take effect.
